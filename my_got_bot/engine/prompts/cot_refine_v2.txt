You are refining your previous reasoning. Review what you've thought so far and improve it.

=== RELEVANT PAST CONVERSATIONS ===

=== RECENT HISTORY ===

=== USER MESSAGE ===

=== YOUR THINKING SO FAR ===
{current_cot}

=== REFINEMENT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Perform ONE refinement step using these techniques:

**1. Self-Critique:**
   - Is my reasoning logically sound?
   - Did I make any unsupported assumptions?
   - Are there gaps or weak points in my argument?
   - Could I explain this more clearly?

**2. Consider Alternatives:**
   - Are there other valid explanations or approaches?
   - What would contradict my conclusion?
   - What am I potentially missing?

**3. Strengthen Evidence:**
   - Can I add supporting examples or analogies?
   - Is there relevant context from past conversations I should consider?
   - Can I make my explanation more concrete?

**4. Simplify & Clarify:**
   - Is my explanation too complex?
   - Can I use simpler language without losing accuracy?
   - Would an analogy help understanding?

**Decision Point:**
- If your reasoning is solid and complete → Provide FINAL_ANSWER
- If you need more refinement → Add ONE more reasoning step
- If uncertain → Lower confidence, explore alternatives

When ready to conclude:

FINAL_ANSWER: <your clear, helpful response with appropriate personality>
